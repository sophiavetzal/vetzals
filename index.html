                    <p class="course-description">In this course, I collaborated with two team members to develop an autonomous vehicle using a small-scale RC platform. The primary goal was to design and implement integrated sensing, planning, and control modules that enable the vehicle to operate across a range of scenarios, from manual driving and driver-assist modes to fully autonomous driving, using a LiDAR sensor. Key topics covered included localization, mapping, electric propulsion systems, electric machines and drive systems, robotics, control systems, estimation, signal processing, and optimization.

It is designed to aid in deciding what stream to pursue, as McMaster has a general first year. It covered the fundamentals of Python, Autodesk Inventor, Materials Engineering, a design process, and professional technical writing. I completed four team-based design projects, each focused on a real-world engineering problem. This included designing a wind turbine, developing a sterilization container, creating an autonomous robot arm recycling system, and building an assistive device for an individual with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Project teams were divided into subgroups of 2–3 based on responsibilities such as modeling or coding. Learn more about the sterilization container in the Projects section!</p>

                    <p class="project-description">Applied concepts from the entire course to develop a self-driving algorithm that avoids obstacles and selects the best direction of travel. First, a wall-following controller was designed that enables the vehicle to drive along a hallway by following two side walls. The code was then further developed to use the largest gap in front of the vehicle to find the best direction of travel for the vehicle. Two parallel virtual barrier lines, one on each side of the direction of travel, are then found to separate the vehicle from obstacles in its environment. These virtual barrier lines are obtained by formulating and solving a Quadratic Optimization with Linear Inequality constraints. This is done with the python package quadprog. The objective is to maximize the distance between the virtual barrier lines, while keeping all obstacle points behind them. The wall-following controller from the earlier algorithm is used to center the vehicle between the two barrier lines found from solving the optimization problem. This was done in both a simulation and real environment. </p>

The system uses a microcontroller, time-of-flight (ToF) sensor, and stepper motor. The process begins when a button on the controller is pressed. The ToF sensor takes measurements and communicates them to the microcontroller via I2C. These measurements are then transmitted to a PC over UART. Python code processes the data to calculate and store the corresponding x, y, and z coordinates. The stepper motor collects 16 points per rotation and completes three full rotations. Finally, the data is plotted on a 3D graph to visually represent the surrounding environment.
